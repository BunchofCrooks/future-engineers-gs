Steering mechanism Even if the game rules of the Future Engineering competition does not require to build your own vehicle and allow to use a base of an RC (remote controlled) toy cars, someone would find useful to design everything from very beginning. It will allow to get grain control over the hardware, increase efficiency and reduce errors introduced by the third party's implementations. The design of the vehicle is dictated by the approach is chosen to drive the rear wheels and implement the steering mechanics. Usually, in the most simple case the rear wheels are fixed on the same axle and rotated by one DC motor. The steering mechanism on the front axle could be build in several ways where the main idea is to change of the angle of the front wheels direction. Since these concepts are already widely implemented in the RC toy cars and the RC sport vehicles, it makes sense to make a research through available materials.

When you get a basic understanding how your vehicle could look like, you can look at the following instructions that could help to think of the assembling process in more professional manner: Click on the picture or here to download the instructions. Note, that some instructions above uses two motors to rotate the rear wheels. In some cases it will make the control of the vehicle more complex since the motors could rotate asynchronously that needs to be compensated by the steering. Tires By the way, during experiments you can find that the tires in the vehicle have no enough friction with the field surface, so it make sense to consider to try to prepare your own tires for wheels.

Design leading questions Definitely, the obstacles detection and decision making for the motion planning must be done ad-hoc by en electronic brain rather than by a human being. That's why it is needed to choose the set of controllers, electronic components and design the logic to connect them to each other. They will mostly rely on the way how the vehicle will solve the task. But some ideas will be common due to the nature of the challenge. Here is the set of questions that is intended to boost the process of thinking about electronic filling of the autonomous car: Will a camera be used to recognize the traffic signs (red and green pillars)? Is it an USB-camera or a natively plugged device (like the Raspberry Pi camera)? How fast the video stream from the camera must be handled? What is suitable performance of the decision making controller? Will the vehicle be controlled by one controller or by a pair of the main controller and an auxiliary controller? How will the roles between controllers be distributed: handling of the video stream, direct control of the motors, direct acquiring of sensors readings? Will capacity (input/output pins) of each controller be enough for this? What kind of connection will be between the controllers? Will the walls be detected by camera or by a distance/proximity sensors? Should a special lens kit be used to make the camera's field of view wider to recognize both traffic signs and walls or several cameras will be used instead? How will the passed path be measured: by counting numbers of turns with a compass or a gyroscope, by calculating the distance with an encoder(s), by detecting colored lines with light sensors? Will a gyroscope and/or an accelerometer be used to assist in accurate driving -- get rid of excessive steering mechanism shifts? What kind of power sources should be used to supply controllers, motors and senors? Should it be one source for all consumers or dedicated sources for controllers and motors? Overview Before start drawing schemes and purchasing the components, usually it is worth to review existing solutions: what electromechanical components are the common practice to use for the robotics projects where the aim is to create a self-driving vehicle. This is a short collection of the links to study. Descriptions of these projects provides different level of details that's why we list several of them to demonstrate diversity of approaches: Is your toy RC car is good to become autonomous robotics car? A good start to turn an RC car to Arduino controlled car An example of equipping an RC car with sensors and Arduino controller Not sure how to start driving autonomously? Start with these fours simple turtle-like car based on Arduino: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Yet another DIY autonomous vehicles but pay attention on the powering Vehicle's brain If this is the first time when you meet with Single Board Microcontrollers like Arduino or Single Board Computers like Raspberry Pi, consider to spend extra time to understand the difference between them. For example, the goal of this article to summarize advantages of SBM and SBC with advices when use Arduino, when Raspberry Pi and when both. Okay, hope the advantages are clear, and that is why it make sense to compare the Raspberry Pi with other SBCs: Click on the picture to watch the video Another interesting approach could be is to use and integrated Computer Vision boards instead of SBC. This material compares OpenMV, Pixy and Jevois. Someone already decides to build the vehicle with two controllers: the primary controller is to execute navigation, path planning and work with a camera, the secondary is to requests sensors and/or control motors. Most probably the secondary controller will be an Arduino based and the following step is learn how it could be connected to the primary one. There are several protocols that can be used for this and this document is good to start getting familiar with them. Next, depending on the protocol the following materials will help you implement communication channel between Raspberry Pi an Arduino: Serial communication: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . I2C communication: 1 , 2 , 3 . Motors The minimal number of motors that required for a vehicle participating in the Future Engineers competition is two: a driving motor and a motor to steer. Motor Basics Motor Driver Using a Servo Motor for the Steering The driving motor makes the car moving. This motors consumes more power than can be provided either by Arduino or by Raspberry Pi therefore an additional motor driver circuit is being used. Here are examples how to control DC motors from Arudino: 1 , 2 , 3 ; or from Raspberry Pi: 1 . As an alternative to the DC motors, one could consider to use a stepper motor or a continuous servomotor . A servo motor is the most suitable way to change direction of the vehicle since it provides precise control on the steering process. Here are examples how to control DC motors from Arudino: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; or from Raspberry Pi: 1 . Encoders It is important to control the driving motor speed and the distance the vehicle is moving. One of the simplest device for this is an encoder: Click on the picture to watch the video These three articles will help you better understand how encoders work: 1 , 2 , 3 . And here are practical examples how an encoder can be added to the autonomous vehicle: Setup an encoder on a chassis Use encoder built in the motor Distance sensors Distance and proximity sensors are commonly used in robotics. For the autonomous vehicle participating in the Future Engineers competition such kind of devices will allow to control the distance to the walls as so the car will move in the middle between them. Here is a set of short reviews of different sensors (ultrasonic, infrared and LiDAR) describing the principles how they work and which advantages and disadvantages they have: 1 , 2 , 3 . IMU IMU is an abbreviation for the term Inertial Measurement Unit. Usually, this abbreviation is used for a device that combines accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. In order to get a useful data from this sensor, in most cases it is required to implement concepts from the linear algebra and calculus. But depending on the libraries provided by the sensor manufactures and/or open source community, this could be already simplified a lot as so the IMU sensor can be used to measure the path driven by the vehicle and to control steering smoothness. We provide links to three articles that are good start to understand how IMU can be used in a robotics projects: 1 , 2 , 3 . Power Powering of the self-driving car for the robotics competition is not a trivial task. Depending on types of the motors and number of controllers, it could be found that separate power sources must be provided for different consumers.

Arduino Since the Arduino board is a quite mature technology there are lots of materials covering different aspects of developing programs to control peripheral devices connected to the controller. The development process is trivial: the program are written on a PC or a laptop, compiled and downloaded to the Arudino controller by using a USB cable. Most probably, you will use Arduino IDE to create programs, so it will perform all the actions described above automatically. Before attempts to prepare the first sketch (a sketch is the name that Arduino uses for a program) read few advices that could help to become more successful as an Arduino programmer: Writing code of Arduino devices 5 tips to improve your Arduino coding skills . If you had no any experience with Arduino, it makes sense to go through the set of lessons to get basic ideas about this device programming. So, do not hesitate and look at Arduino lessons . Different ways to control motors and query sensors has been covered in the section Electromechanical components therefore they will not be repeated here. Instead it is necessary to focus on some tips and tricks, and advanced techniques that are used for complex projects. For example, the portal The Robotics Back-End has the great list of Arduino tutorials. Here you can find an answer for question whether Arduino is good for industrial projects , learn how to write multitasking applications on Arduino , practise to create your own Arduino library and understand techniques to write realtime software for Arduino . Eventually, you could be ready to use the Arduino board as a powerful driver. The main controller (Raspberry Pi) will encode and send commands to this driver, it will decode the commands and schedule getting information from sensors or prepare instructions for motors. Consider the following set of useful tutorials and libraries that could help you build control systems based on Arduino: A library for Non-trivial programing for Arduino Event-based Programming with Arduino State machines with Arduino: State machines tutorial Multitasking on the Arduino with a Finite State Machine Finite State Machine Programming Basics: part 1 and part 2 A library that implements a basic State Machine Separately it is necessary to say about the digital signal processing . When you work with digital and analogue sensors, you will definitely meet with the fact that most of these sensors are noisy. In some cases they could have their own noise suppression mechanism but sometimes it is necessary to implement your own approach to handle data received from the sensors. That's why it makes sense to start learning different ways how to \"de-noise\" the sensor readings, so take into consideration the following articles: Three Methods to Filter Noisy Arduino Measurements Simple High-pass, Band-pass and Band-stop Filtering Implementation of Basic Filters Raspberry Pi One could consider the Raspberry Pi board as a usual computer (PC or laptop) -- a general operating system needs to be installed on the device, it must be equipped with a storage to keep files, a keyboard and a display could be connected to a special sockets. This allows every one to experiment with the board before it will be incorporated in a robotics project. Although Microsoft Windows 10 supports the Raspberry Pi, the common recommendation is to install a Linux-based operating system. Depending on the type of distribution you will choose, low power consumption and high performance could be achieved with a proper configuration. So, in order to getting with the board, at first, start with the installation . Then, especially you did not work before with a Linux systems, take a tour what is available on the Raspberry Pi to be used on daily basis and dig into Linux essentials to learn more about commands that could help you to use the system more effectively. As soon as the first issues were solved and there is an understanding how turn on the board, start using it and gracefully switch off, the next step will be to start programming it. Even if it is possible to program on any language you would like, the most convenient way will be to use Python. This programming languages has low entrance level and have tons of materials in the Internet to begin coding with it. For example, you can try LearnPython.org . If the first programming concepts are clear, the logical continuation is to understand how the language can be used to interact with electronic components . And, finally, you would like to start using the Raspberry Pi together with a camera. Here it is necessary to say, that the board supports several options to work with camera. First of all, the same as for the general purpose computer, the camera can be plugged into an USB socket. In the python code you need to get access a proper device (usually, /dev/video0 ) and start reading frames from it: #!/usr/bin/python import os import pygame, sys from pygame.locals import * import pygame.camera width = 640 height = 480 #initialise pygame pygame.init() pygame.camera.init() cam = pygame.camera.Camera(\"/dev/video0\",(width,height)) cam.start() #setup window windowSurfaceObj = pygame.display.set_mode((width,height),1,16) pygame.display.set_caption('Camera') #take a picture image = cam.get_image() cam.stop() #display the picture catSurfaceObj = image windowSurfaceObj.blit(catSurfaceObj,(0,0)) pygame.display.update() #save picture pygame.image.save(windowSurfaceObj,'picture.jpg') The code is taken from the official forum Another way is to use a specialized Raspberry Pi camera. Since it is connected through a special socket, you can get better results from performance point of view. But from other side, before using the camera's port, it needs to be explicitly turned on in the Raspberry PI Software Configuration tool. You can follow this tutorial that help you to check how the Raspberry Pi camera can be programed. And now you could be ready to start building a self-driven car around the Raspberry Pi! Don't rush -- consider also an approach to connect to the board by a Secure Shell terminal through WiFi . It will be more convenient to run and stop programs remotely without necessity to have keyboard and monitor plugged into a moving car. At this moment, you can read a short story (with lots of technical details) how to build a Vision-Controlled Car Using Raspberry Pi From Scratch . Since Python is a general purpose language and the Raspberry Pi board runs a general purpose operating system you can implement any method or use any technique to write a control program for your self-driven car. Definitely the program should not be linear since the robot must act adequately when drive through the track and avoid an obstacle.
