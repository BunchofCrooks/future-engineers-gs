The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles. Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car, equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections. More details about the competition can be found on the official site of WRO Association . The Future Engineers challenge does not limit the students with any specific hardware and programming languages that is why working with electromechanical components (motors and sensors) and/or with a micro controller could cause some difficulties. Moreover, the most effective way to make the car fully autonomous is to use a camera and computer vision algorithms which are also completely new direction in WRO competition and never used before. Therefore the goal of this site is to provide materials for an initial understanding how the self-driving vehicle can be build and how it can be programmed to achieve a result in the competition.","title":"WRO Future Engineers Getting Started"},{"location":"#wro-future-engineers-getting-started","text":"Starting from the season 2020 World Robot Olympiad extends the set of the competitions suggested for school students around the world by a new competition \"Future Engineers\".

Steering mechanism Even if the game rules of the Future Engineering competition does not require to build your own vehicle and allow to use a base of an RC (remote controlled) toy cars, someone would find useful to design everything from very beginning. It will allow to get grain control over the hardware, increase efficiency and reduce errors introduced by the third party's implementations. The design of the vehicle is dictated by the approach is chosen to drive the rear wheels and implement the steering mechanics. Usually, in the most simple case the rear wheels are fixed on the same axle and rotated by one DC motor. The steering mechanism on the front axle could be build in several ways where the main idea is to change of the angle of the front wheels direction. Since these concepts are already widely implemented in the RC toy cars and the RC sport vehicles, it makes sense to make a research through available materials. For example, this video presents one of the way to build the steering mechanism: More videos referenced in the next list consider other approaches to acheive the same goal: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 . When you get a basic understanding how your vehicle could look like, you can look at the following instructions that could help to think of the assembling process in more professional manner: Click on the picture or here to download the instructions. Note, that some instructions above uses two motors to rotate the rear wheels. In some cases it will make the control of the vehicle more complex since the motors could rotate asynchronously that needs to be compensated by the steering. Tires By the way, during experiments you can find that the tires in the vehicle have no enough friction with the field surface, so it make sense to consider to try to prepare your own tires for wheels. The following links could bring other brilliant ideas how to make the tires for the vehicle: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .","title":"Chassis"},{"location":"chassis/#chassis","text":"This section covers such aspects of building the vehicle for the competition as a chassis and tires.","title":"Chassis"},{"location":"chassis/#steering-mechanism","text":"Even if the game rules of the Future Engineering competition does not require to build your own vehicle and allow to use a base of an RC (remote controlled) toy cars, someone would find useful to design everything from very beginning.

What is suitable performance of the decision making controller? Will the vehicle be controlled by one controller or by a pair of the main controller and an auxiliary controller? How will the roles between controllers be distributed: handling of the video stream, direct control of the motors, direct acquiring of sensors readings?

Will the walls be detected by camera or by a distance/proximity sensors? Should a special lens kit be used to make the camera's field of view wider to recognize both traffic signs and walls or several cameras will be used instead? How will the passed path be measured: by counting numbers of turns with a compass or a gyroscope, by calculating the distance with an encoder(s), by detecting colored lines with light sensors? Will a gyroscope and/or an accelerometer be used to assist in accurate driving -- get rid of excessive steering mechanism shifts? What kind of power sources should be used to supply controllers, motors and senors?
