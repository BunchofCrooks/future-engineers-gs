# Chassis

This section covers such aspects of building the vehicle for the competition as a chassis and tires.

## Steering mechanism

Even if the game rules of the Future Engineering competition does not require to build your own vehicle and allow to use a base of an RC (remote controlled) toy cars, someone would find useful to design everything from very beginning. It will allow to get grain control over the hardware, increase efficiency and reduce errors introduced by the third party's implementations.

The design of the vehicle is dictated by the approach is chosen to drive the rear wheels and implement the steering mechanics. Usually, in the most simple case the rear wheels are fixed on the same axle and rotated by one DC motor. The [steering mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering){target=_blank} on the front axle could be build in several ways where the main idea is to change of the angle of the front wheels direction.

Since these concepts are already widely implemented in the RC toy cars and the RC sport vehicles, it makes sense to make a research through available materials. 

For example, this video presents one of the way to build the steering mechanism:

More videos referenced in the next list consider other approaches to acheive the same goal: [1](https://youtu.be/NjAQMPVhdBk){target=_blank}, [2](https://youtu.be/ePDCRdfabZo){target=_blank}, [3](https://youtu.be/CsdP2IEyl2g){target=_blank}, [4](https://youtu.be/NL5-FV28uRA){target=_blank}, [5](https://youtu.be/12CiZusgZng){target=_blank}, [6](https://youtu.be/8JMM5NwO34I){target=_blank}, [7](https://youtu.be/5rJYZLX6uY4){target=_blank}, [8](https://youtu.be/x_3DDoNCBQk){target=_blank}, [9](https://youtu.be/2QUsQxnrYEs){target=_blank}, [10](https://youtu.be/d73MOvDyg38){target=_blank}.

When you get a basic understanding how your vehicle could look like, you can look at the following instructions that could help to think of the assembling process in more professional manner:

Note, that some instructions above uses two motors to rotate the rear wheels. In some cases it will make the control of the vehicle more complex since the motors could rotate asynchronously that needs to be compensated by the steering.

## Tires

By the way, during experiments you can find that the tires in the vehicle have no enough friction with the field surface, so it make sense to consider to try to prepare your own tires for wheels.
