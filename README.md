# WRO Future Engineers Getting Started

This repository contains a set of materials to help studends and their coaches to start preparing to the WRO Future Engineers competition.

The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles. Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car, equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections.
